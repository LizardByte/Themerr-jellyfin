Jellyfin Server Logs
--------------------

Unfortunately, Jellyfin does not separate the logs by plugin. You will need to review the server logs.

The log location varies, depending on your environment. See
`Jellyfin Server Logs <https://jellyfin.org/docs/general/administration/configuration#log-directory>`__ for more
information.

.. Attention:: Before uploading logs, it would be wise to review the data in the log file. Themerr does not have
   control of the information that is logged by the Jellyfin server.
